This package implements multiple GPU-compatible PyTorch solvers
to the Fused Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport problem.

**This package is under active development. There is no guarantee that the API and solvers
won't change in the near future.**

## Installation

### From PyPI

In a dedicated Python env, run:

```bash
pip install fugw
```

If you need to call functions within `fugw.scripts`, you should also run

```bash
pip install "fugw[scripts]"
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexisthual/fugw.git
cd fugw
```

In a dedicated Python env, run:
